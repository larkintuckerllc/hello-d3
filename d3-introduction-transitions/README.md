# d3-introduction
This is a super simple demo for data joins in [D3.js](http://https://d3js.org/). It's the code companion of my tutorial [Enter, Update, Exit – An Introduction to D3.js, The Web’s Most Popular Visualization Toolkit](https://medium.com/@c_behrens/enter-update-exit-6cafc6014c36). If you're just getting started with D3 and want to get your head around one of its core principles, _data joins_, go check it out.

You can see the demo in action (https://rawgit.com/niceone/d3-introduction/master/index.html)[here]. 

And if you have questions, suggestions, or simply spotted a bug, please let me know!
